* Includes a version of *ricap* and a modified version of *cutmix* (that fixes a bug in the lambda calculation).
* It also includes 2 functions to visualize the impact of single-image transforms (*show_single_img_tfms*) or multi-image transforms (*show_multi_img_tfms*). 
* To use the code you can either clone the repo, or copy the exp/nb_new_data_augmentation.py code into your code.
